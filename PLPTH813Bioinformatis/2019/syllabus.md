#### Goal of the course
PLPTH813 will cover the basic principle of regular bioinformatics applications and emphasize the practice of bioinformatics in biological research. The course will introduce some useful computation skills, such as Unix commands and R programming, in data analysis at the beginning of the semester, and then will apply these skills throughout the course. This course will be focused on the application of bioinformatics in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, including genome assembly, variant discovery, genotyping, RNA-Seq, and so on. The ultimate goal of this course is to help students to be prepared for the next-generation biological research that often generates large data and requires researchers to have the capability in data management and data mining.

#### Other notes
We will use the software R throughout the course. Students in the class are required to have the Beocat account that allows you to access the Beocat server and use R-studio through Beocat.

#### Academic Honesty and Integrity Statement
Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

#### Statements for Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.  If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career Advising Center at acac@k-state.edu or call 785-826-2649.

#### Statement Defining Expectations for Classroom Conduct
All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article VI, Section 3, number 2.  Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.
