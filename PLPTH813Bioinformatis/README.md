### Goal of the course
PLPTH813 covers the basic principle of regular bioinformatics applications and emphasizes the practice of bioinformatics in biological research. The course introduces some useful computation skills, such as Unix commands and R programming, in data analysis at the beginning of the semester, and then applies these skills throughout the course. This course is focused on the application of bioinformatics in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, including genome assembly, variant discovery, genotyping, RNA-Seq, and so on. The ultimate goal of this course is to help students to be prepared for the next-generation biological research that often generates large data and requires researchers to have the capability in data management and data mining.
